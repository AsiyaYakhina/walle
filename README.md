WALL-E SCENE
=====

This is a scene from movie Wall-E that is recreated in 3D using a Three.js - a 3D Javascript library.

Both Wall-E's and Eve's geometries are built with extruded geometries and bezier surfaces.

WALL-E'S EYES
Wall-E's eyes contain 2 extra cameras that continuously "record" the scene. The video that the cameras are recording is mapped as a texture on the eyes' surface. That way, Well-E's eyes are continuously reflecting the scene.

TEXTURE MAPPING
I mapped various kinds of metallic textures on Wall-E's parts to achieve a similar kind of grunge feel of his character that the viewers witness in the original film.

LIGHTING
I used directional and ambient lighting to highlight the form and the material of the characters to the viewer's eyes.

ANIMATION
In the scene Wall-E is animated to turn his head towards Eve, hand her a stem and tilt his head just like he does in the film. As a response, Eve swirls up and down.

Interact with the scene by hovering over it zoom in r out, and dragging the cursor on the scene.
